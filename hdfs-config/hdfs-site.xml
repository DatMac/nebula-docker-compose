        <description>
            Default block replication. The actual number of replications can be
            specified when the file is created. For our single DataNode setup,
            a replication factor of 1 is appropriate.

        <description>
            Whether clients should use datanode hostnames when connecting to datanodes.
            Set to true if your client can resolve datanode hostnames (e.g., 'datanode' in Docker network).
            Set to false if datanodes report their IP addresses and clients need to connect directly to IPs.
            In most Docker setups, 'true' or omitting this property (which often defaults to true) works.
